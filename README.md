# Sorting Performance Comparison

Repo includes C implementation's of sorting algorithms to demonstrate performance differences. 


## Files

| File | Description|
|------|-------------|
| bubblesort.c | C implementation of bubblesort |
| mergesort.c | C implementation of mergesort |
| mergesort_multithreaded.c | C implementation of mergesort featuring multithreading |
| test_creator.py | Python script that prints a sample input to be used by the sorting algorithms. The input features a list in descending order, where the size of the input can be altered using the SIZE constant|
| test?.txt | A collection of sample test inputs that can be used to test algorithms by attatching to stdin |
